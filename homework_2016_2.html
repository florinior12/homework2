<tr><td>Impressed by the winnings of your programs at the game table during his visit at <span style="font-style:italic;">Las Javas</span>,
a Martian software developer, <span style="font-style:italic;">MarsWorks</span>, has just asked for your help to design a package for its
<span style="font-style:italic;">JavaLab</span> computing environment, targeted to linear systems analysis.
The reward is truly astonishing, a trip to the company headquarters on Mars with the next martian mission with humans on board.</td></tr>

<h3>Application description:</h3>
<span style="font-style:italic;">
You are required to design the necessary classes for the object-oriented simulation of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems.
The intended simulations use convolution and impulse response to compute the output of such systems.
One class is needed to define the signals. It embeds a vector of samples and the common linear operations with signals, i.e. scalar multiplication,
time-shifting, superposition and convolution.
Another class defines the system elements, with subclasses that are fitted for various system element types.
The system elements used for linear systems are amplifiers, delay elements, adders, and filters:
<ul>
<li>The amplifier has an input and an output, and is characterized by a gain. The output signal is the
multiplication of the input signal with the constant gain value.</li>
<li>The delay element shifts the input signal with a constant number of time units to the right.</li>
<li>An adder has a couple of inputs and one output. Its output signal is the superposition of all input signals.</li>
<li>A filter object has only one input and is characterized by a finite impulse response.
Its output is the convolution of the input signal with the impulse response.</li>
</ul>
The elements that share a signal are connected between them. The systems which are to be modeled are without feedback,
and only finite impulse response filters (FIR) are allowed for filter elements. Also the systems will have a single input
and a single output.

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<!--------------------------------------- SIGNAL ----------------------------->
<h4>Signals</h4>
The <span style="font-family:monospace;">Signal</span> object encapsulates a vector of samples and defines the signal general operations.
Two or more signals may be added to get a superposed signal, and a signal may be multiplied by a constant or delayed (shifted to the right) by a constant
number of time units. The sample value domain is contiunous.

<h4>System elements</h4>
There may be four types of system elements, the adder, for superposition, the linear amplifier, for scaling, the delay element, for time-shifting,
and the filter, for convolution.
All these are derived from the abstract <span style="font-family:monospace;">Element</span> class,
that declares the input and output fields, and the method that computes the output.
